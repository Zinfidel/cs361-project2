Size K Subset Generator

Description
-----------
Produces all subsets of a given set.

Usage
-----
The SizeKSubset class is meant to be used by another class that will provide
a suitable set of data and invoke the appropriate iterator methods.

The SizeKSbuset class does have a stub *Main* method that will generate some
sample data for a set of size n = 10, consisting of the integers from 0 to 9,
with a subset size of k = 5.

There is some commented-out code in the *Main* method that can be used to
explore some edge cases.
